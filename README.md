# CloudFormation Stack Rename

The following script will programmatically perform the following steps:

* Get resource import IDs from drift results
* Set all resources in the stack to retain on delete
* Delete the stack, whilst retaining the resource
* Create a new stack, importing the resources with their current state back into the stack

As the stack is recreated entirely, the history of the stack will not be retained. Note that not all stacks will support a stack rename, only those that exclusively contain importable types.

> :exclamation: This script is not thoroughly tested and you should attempt to use this on a non-critical resource before real-world usage as some resources refuse to re-import for a variety of reasons. I am not responsible for your data loss.

* This is the refactored build and works slightly differently

## Installation

To install please run the following:

```
./setup.sh
```
This will configure a python virtual env and install all dependant packages in there.


## Usage

```
$ ./stack_rename --help
usage: stack_rename [options]
Version: 0.1

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        specify the location of the config file, defaults to 'configs/config.yaml'
  -L, --auth            Authentication required, default False
  -M MFA, --mfa MFA     MFA device id - this should be available in your aws account
  -A PRIMARY_ACCOUNT, --primary-account PRIMARY_ACCOUNT
                        Your primary account, this should be your main primary account
  -S SWITCH_ACCOUNT, --switch-account SWITCH_ACCOUNT
                        AWS Secondary Account number to switch into
  -R ROLE_NAME, --role-name ROLE_NAME
                        AWS role name, this is used for switching
  -r REGION, --region REGION
                        Specify the aws region, defaults to "eu-west-2"
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        Specify the aws profile, defaults to "default"
  -s STACK_NAME, --stack_name STACK_NAME
                        Specify the current cloudformation stack name to import resources from
  -n NEW_STACK, --new_stack NEW_STACK
                        Specify the new cloudformation stack name
```

Typical usage is as follows:

```
source env/bin/activate # This is to enter into the virtual env
stack_rename -r <region> -s <old_stack_name> -n <new_stack_name>
deactivate # This exists the python virtual env
```

### Supported Resources

The following resources are supported for stack rename (if other resources are within the stack, the script will refuse to continue):

The following resources are supported for stack rename, in line with what is listed here: [Former 2 - importable.txt](https://github.com/iann0036/former2/blob/master/util/importable.txt)

They are not listed here but can be viewed here: [cloudformation importable config](configs/cloudformation.yaml)

Please note if they are not listed above they will be recreated - The tool does warn about this and provides the option to exit.

### Known Issues

* Stacks that have an `Fn::ImportValue` reference against it will cause the stack to be unable to be deleted
* Some transforms may affect the RetainPolicy - check if this affects you before executing
